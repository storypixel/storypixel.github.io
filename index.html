                  I started app development at a concierge kiosk startup in 2001. My Flash interface was in local news footage. I was over
                  the moon. My mom cared but no one else really did.

                  In 2004 I transitioned from Flash to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. At the time ExpressionEngine was a big deal, so I worked a lot in that.
                  About then years later I was hired to their small remote team, EllisLab. There is something to be said
                  for the pocket cultures within the tech and design space. I learned a lot and met some great folks.

                  In my early twenties, most nights I'd lose track of time while working. Afterwards I'd go to Wendy's because it was next to the office, and get a burger and fries. Maybe I did this too much because one day I was doing pull-ups casually and passed out. This was the moment that got me into fitness and nutrition.

                  For me, the harder the creative work is to start, the less likely it is I'll do it. It's why I love calligraphy. It's easy
                  to do something cool quickly. Oil painting, while amazing and fun, has a higher threshold of effort therefore I don't paint much.

                  Growing up in a small town in Kentucky, most folks were extroverted. And although I lived in a slightly larger Lexington for several years, I moved to Pittsburgh. Here I experienced some culture
                  shock, which I kinda needed. Though it wasn't for me long-term, I came out of Pittsburgh with crucial friendships and experiences that I can't imagine missing
                  out on.

                  To my occasional chagrin, I find it hard to dislike people even if they are at first unfriendly. When someone is antagonistic or off-putting, I tend to try to win them over or figure out why they are that way. I've made a lot of friends this way and I find first impressions are only true half the time. But also not everyone is going to love me and I'm okay with that these days.

                  I suffered daily headaches as a child. These headaches could make me throw up. Out of necessity, I knelt down similar to
                  how a toddler naps. I'd put my forehead on the ground and would then visualize my pain as a red syrupy substance
                  leaving the front of my head through a small hole, draining down into the Earth. It took about 20 minutes
                  and then I felt better.
