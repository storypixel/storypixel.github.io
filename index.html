                I started app development at a concierge kiosk startup in 2001. My Flash interface was in a shot on the local news. My mom
                cared but no one else really did. Near the end a saleman came up to me and said, in the context of a huge contract for becoming a data provier, "Hey I told Lycos we know XML. Do we?"

                In 2004 I transitioned from Flash to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. At the time ExpressionEngine was a big deal, so I worked a lot in that.
                About then years later I was added to their small remote team, EllisLab. There is something to be said
                for the pocket cultures within the tech and design space.

                In my early twenties, when I'd stay up developing all night, I'd go to Wendy's afterwards, around 12:30am, and eat some burgers. For over a year I did this. One day
                I was doing pull-ups and passed out. I looked healthy but wasn't. It was then I became a vegetarian for several years.

                I suffered daily headaches as a child. These headaches could make me throw up. Out of necessity, I knelt down similar to
                how a toddler naps. I'd put my forehead on the ground and would then visualize my pain as a red syrupy substance
                leaving the front of my head through a small hole, draining down into the Earth. It took about 20 minutes
                and then I felt better.
